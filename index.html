        <p>Trees provide oxygen without which the life of humans is impossible on this Earth. Therefore we can say that
            trees fulfill the basic requirement of human survival. Apart from oxygen, the food that we need to satisfy
            our hunger comes from trees. Trees also provide us with fuel and shelter. The “Ayurveda”, the field of
            medical science is dependent on trees for their medicines. In summers, trees give us shade and cool air. The
            air from air conditioners and other appliances is nothing in front of natural air from trees.

            Climate change, rainfall, etc are managed by trees. Soil erosion is well protected by trees. Trees are also
            helpful in protecting us from natural disasters to a great extent. Not only humans, but trees are also a
            blessing for all living organisms. Trees are the homes of many animals. Apart from these things, trees also
            provide us, with rubber, timber, fruits, etc. Although the government is taking several steps to conserve
            trees and forests, it will be successful only when the entire nation comes up together with the same goal.
            People should also support organizations and communities that protest against saving trees. Creating
            awareness among the general public would be a good step to control deforestation. Trees are an enormous
            resource that needs to save instead of cut down.

            People can save trees by planting more and more. Trees should not be cut down for personal use. The usage of
            things like paper that comes from trees should be minimized. We can also adopt the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse,
            Recycle) strategy to conserve trees. The mistake of humans cutting trees blindly will disturb the Earth
            majorly. A Healthy and happy earth can only be achieved through a healthy tree population.</p>
